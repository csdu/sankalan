# “BRAINSPARK – Does your gray matter?”

Let’s see if you have one tenth the knowledge of what “Dashanan Ravana” had, because that is exactly what is needed here. Let your brain do the workout now.

We don’t want you to dig your scientific, commercial, literary or general knowledge.\
All we want you to do is learn how Chacha Chaudhary operated!
Because, <I>“ Chacha Chaudhary ka dimaag computer se bhi tez chalta hai ”</I>\
Sankalan’19 invites the lightening of your brains to DUCS.

### ROUND #1
Let light fall on your brain as you face 30 MCQs checking your quantitative aptitude in the first round.
### ROUND #2
For the next and final round, we allow you to brainstorm like kids having a grown up’s brain to solve some very “basic” puzzles and riddles!

# FURTHER DETAILS
* Team should be of size 2.
